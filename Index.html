                <h2>Introduction to web design system</h2>
                <p>
                    A web design system, often referred to as a design system or a UI (User Interface) design system, is a comprehensive set
                    of guidelines, components, and assets that are used to create and maintain a consistent and cohesive user interface for a
                    website or web application.
                </p>
                <h3>Key aspects that are important within the web design:</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Design Principles:</strong> A web design system typically begins with a set of core design principles or philosophies.
                    These principles guide the overall design direction and ensure consistency throughout the project. Principles could include 
                    simplicity, accessibility, usability, and brand alignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Typography:</strong> A consistent typographic system defines the fonts, font sizes, line heights, and text styles used 
                    throughout the website. It ensures readability and maintains a cohesive visual identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Color Palette:</strong> The system includes a defined color palette with primary and secondary colors. These colors are
                    chosen to reflect the brand's identity and can be used consistently across the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Layout Grids:</strong> Grid systems provide structure to the layout of web pages. A design system may define grid layouts
                    for various screen sizes and devices, making it easier to create responsive designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Spacing and Padding:</strong>  Consistent spacing and padding guidelines ensure that elements are properly aligned and have
                    enough breathing room. This helps create a visually pleasing and readable interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>UI Components:</strong> A critical part of a web design system is the collection of reusable UI components. These include 
                    buttons, forms, navigation menus, cards, modals, and more. Each component is designed with a consistent style and functionality to
                    ensure a seamless user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Iconography</strong> Icons and symbols are an essential part of web design. A design system often includes a library of custom
                    icons or guidelines for using common icon sets. These icons should align with the overall design aesthetic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Interactive Behavior:</strong> Guidelines for interactive elements like hover effects, animations, and transitions are essential
                    for creating engaging user experiences. These behaviors should align with the design system's principles.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                <h2>Benefits from using a WDS</h2>
                <p>
                    Using a web design system can offer numerous benefits to web developers, designers, and organizations. A web design system is a 
                    collection of reusable components, patterns, and guidelines that help create cohesive and consistent web interfaces.
                </p>
                <h3>Here are some of the key benefits of using a web design system:</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Consistency:</strong> A design system ensures consistency in design and user experience across all web pages and applications.
                    It helps maintain a uniform look and feel, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with your website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Design systems streamline the web development process by providing pre-built components and guidelines.
                    This reduces the need to reinvent the wheel for each project, saving time and effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Faster Development:</strong> Web developers can work more efficiently with a design system, as they have access to ready-made 
                    components and code snippets. This speeds up the development process, allowing for quicker project delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Maintenance:</strong> Design systems make it easier to update and maintain your website. When design or branding changes are 
                    needed, you can make updates to the design system, and these changes will propagate to all pages and projects that use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>User Satisfaction:</strong> Consistent and well-designed user interfaces enhance the user experience. Users can become familiar
                    with your design patterns, which can lead to increased user satisfaction and retention.

            <h2>Components</h2>
                <p>
                    A web design system typically includes a variety of components that are used to build web interfaces. These components are designed to be 
                    reusable and follow established design guidelines to ensure consistency and cohesiveness across a website or web application.
                </p>
                <h3>Some common components you might find:</h3>
                <p>

                <p>
                    A style guide for a web design system is a comprehensive document that outlines the design principles, visual elements, and guidelines for 
                    creating and maintaining a consistent and cohesive web design. It serves as a reference for designers, developers, and stakeholders involved
                    in web projects to ensure that the design system is applied consistently across all web pages and applications.

                        Here we have some examples when talking about fonts, remember that depends on the type of web page you want

                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of printing presses and text files. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
                        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it 
                        to make a textbook specimen. Not only did it survive 500 years, but it also entered as filler text in 
                        electronic documents, remaining essentially the same as the original. It was popularized in the 1960s with 
                        the creation of Letraset sheets, which contained Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
                        publishing software such as Aldus PageMaker, which includes versions of Lorem Ipsum.
